# Intro
+ Next-gen sequencing
+ File formats
+ NRENs and old protocols (FTP, SCP, fasp)
+ Attempts at, and problems with cloud computing
+ Tests are run between UCT and UWC (this doesn't belong here?)

# Methods
+ Test speed, overhead and packet size

### Protocols
+ Openssh for FTP, SCP
+ Openssh-portable for HPN patches
+ GridFTP lite
+ No striping for GridFTP
+ Two modes of GridFTP

### Approach
+ Run transfers while logging packets
+ Hosts at UWC, UCT VMs, outside firewalls
+ Stable testing environment
+ 6 test files, generated by slicing a gzipped hg38
+ tcpdump listens on interface, captures packets
+ Capturing packets allows measuring "hidden" metrics
+ Test both UDP modes even though Bresnahan et. al. found UDT better in every way

### Implementation of Testbed
+ Python script is sufficient for various reasons
+ Testing done on Ubuntu 14.04 system
+ The python script accepts X Y Z as arguments
+ Spawns tcpdump process which runs as long as the transfer does
+ tcpdump is filtered
+ Successive and isolated -> controlled
+ Multiple runs for statistical reasons
+ Separate python file does analysis

# Results
+ Tests run at 13h00 and 3h00
+ Some tests save packets
+ Measures chosen practically -> speed and data usage

### Network stability
+ Time of test affects measures
+ Example with fingerprint

### Speed and Data Efficiency
+ Explanations of plots

# Intro
+ Next-gen sequencing
+ File formats
+ NRENs and old protocols (FTP, SCP, fasp)
+ Attempts at, and problems with cloud computing
+ It is useful to know which protocol is best to use in a specific environment

# Methods
+ Create a testbed that can be deployed to an environment to test various protocols
+ Test speed, overhead and packet size
+ Let the user make use of that information as best they can

# Testbed design
+ Approach using python and tcpdump
+ Simple, modular and extensible (to test whatever)
+ No dependencies (the analytics code has some)
+ Can store numbers like total time/speed, and optionally all packet info
+ The python script accepts X Y Z as arguments
+ Successive and isolated -> controlled
+ Suite of analysis tools based on the dumps
+ Tools based on calculating and displaying aggregated info
+ Not meant to come up with "an answer", but rather just presents data

# Test case between UCT and UWC
+ Diagram
+ Hosts at UWC, UCT VMs, outside firewalls
+ Practical test environment

### Approach
+ Testing done on Ubuntu 14.04 system
+ Multiple runs for statistical reasons
+ Tests run at 13h00 and 3h00
+ Tests allow comparison of network congestion as a byproduct
+ Some tests save packets
+ Measures chosen practically -> speed and data usage
+ 6 test files, generated by slicing a gzipped hg38

### Protocols
+ Openssh for FTP, SCP
+ Openssh-portable for HPN patches
+ GridFTP lite
+ No striping for GridFTP
+ Two modes of GridFTP
+ Test both UDP modes even though Bresnahan et. al. found UDT better in every way

### Network stability
+ Time of test affects measures
+ Example with fingerprint

### Speed and Data Efficiency
+ Explanations of plots
